## Test Case: First Test Case for App Component

```jsx
test("First test case for App Component", () => {
  // Render the App component
  render(<App />);
  
  // Find the heading element by text
  const headingText = screen.getByText("Software Testing With Jest");
  
  // Find the image element by title using a regular expression
  const imageTitle = screen.getByTitle(/Software testing banner/i);
  
  // Assert that the heading element is present in the document
  expect(headingText).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  // Assert that the image element is present in the document
  expect(imageTitle).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

1. `test("First test case for App Component", () => {...})`: This line defines a test case using Jest's test function. The first argument is a description of the test case, which helps to identify it in the `test` results. The second argument is a callback function containing the actual test code.

2. `render(<App />);`: This line renders the `<App />` component. In React testing, render is a function provided by testing libraries like ` @testing-library/` react to render components into a virtual DOM environment for testing.

3. `const headingText = screen.getByText("Software Testing With Jest");`: This line uses the `getByText()` function from the screen object provided by `@testing-library/react` to find a DOM element containing the text `"Software Testing With Jest"`. If the element is found, it is assigned to the `headingText` constant.

4.` const imageTitle = screen.getByTitle(/Software testing banner/i);`: This line uses the `getByTitle()` function from the screen object to find a DOM element whose title attribute matches the regular expression `/Software testing banner/i`, which means case-insensitive matching. If the element is found, it is assigned to the `imageTitle` constant.

5. `expect(headingText).toBeInTheDocument();`: This line uses Jest's `expect()` function to assert that the `headingText` element is present in the document. `toBeInTheDocument()` is a matcher provided by Jest that checks whether an element is present in the DOM.

6. `expect(imageTitle).toBeInTheDocument();`: This line similarly asserts that the `imageTitle` element is present in the document.
